# Password Generator

This standalone android app generates a 15-character password with each character randomized, but always guarantees:

- at least 1 letter (uppercase or lowercase);

- at least 1 digit;

- at least 1 symbol.

It includes most characters that are accepted for passwords. As such, it provides very strong passwords that are impossible to bruteforce and satisfies nearly all common password requirements today. It also comes with a 'copy to clipboard' feature. It is up to the user to decide how he wishes to use and/or store this password.

This app was built in React Native & Expo, with the included Gradle tool & use of the Android SDK. It was also tested on my Android device.
